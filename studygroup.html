                <h2>Summary: </h2>
                <p>"Study Group" tells the story of Youn GaMin, an average student who wants to do well at school, but he can never improve his grades despite studying hard. 
                    His parents support him with a private tutor, Lee HanKyeong, but in spite of her efforts, he is unable to make progress, which lands him in Yusung Technical High School, 
                    a school for delinquents. As his entrance exams approach, GaMin's only goal is to get into college through special admissions. As he is surrounded by "future criminals", 
                    he believes it will be easy to rank high since no one is interested in studying anyway. With the motto of "I make opportunities even in the most hellish of situations", 
                    inspired by Bruce Lee, Youn GaMin had his plan chalked out and his eye set on the prize. However, when a variable walks in, things start to fall out of place.</p><br>
