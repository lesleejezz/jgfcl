                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <p>The Beginning After The End follows the life of the late King Grey after his untimely and mysterious death. 
                   Reborn as Arthur Leywin, he seeks to correct his past mistakes in the vibrant new continent of Dicathen, 
                   a world of magic and fantastical creatures. Equipped with the knowledge of a powerful king in his mid-thirties, 
                   Arthur navigates his new life as the magic-wielding child of two retired adventurers and gains purpose through each of his new experiencesâ€”something 
                   he lacked in his previous life. When a kind dragon sacrifices her life to protect him, Arthur resolves to live a sincere, kind, and courageous life with those he loves. 
                   With the help of a lost elf princess and the Elven Kingdom of Elenoir, Arthur begins his long journey to find his true place in the world.</p><br>
