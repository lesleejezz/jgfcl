                <h2>Summary:</h2>
                <p>Eleceed is a Korean webcomic about a kindhearted cat lover named Jiwoo, and the Great Kayden, a wizard-turned-cat.
                    Hidden in the shadows of the modern world, there is an underground of people with superhuman abilities known as the Awakened. 
                    In order to maintain secrecy and peace, many different clans of Awakened exist. However, the most powerful Awakened, the Great Kayden, is a loner. 
                    This comes back to bite him one day when someone manages to ambush him and injure him. In order to hide and recuperate, Kayden takes on the form of a cat he sees nearby. 
                    And now he's stuck. Enter Jiwoo, an Ordinary High-School Student who loves cats and often takes in strays. He comes across Kayden and provides him with a home, 
                    and Kayden soon realizes that Jiwoo can understand him. It turns out that Jiwoo is an Awakened, but is completely unaware of the hidden society people like him live in, and lacks training. 
                    Kayden then decides to make Jiwoo his disciple.</p><br>
